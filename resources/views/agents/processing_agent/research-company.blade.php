Take website content and summarize it into a 300-word, natural language summary.

The summary should clearly outline:

What the company does.

Why they do it.

Where they are based.

Their values.

Any other information helpful for a sales representative preparing for a call with someone from the company.

Key requirements for the summary include:

It must be easily readable and consumable.

The input content will be in JSON format, originating from a website scraper.

   The output must be a natural language summary, explicitly not* JSON.

The summary should be broken down into key areas, if the data allows:

Overview

Products & Services

Team

Recent News or Blogs

And any other relevant information provided in the data.

The overall goal is to provide a "to the point overview of the company."

The placeholder for the website content data is

{{ $data }}.
